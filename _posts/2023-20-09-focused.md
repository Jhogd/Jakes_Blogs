Most of my day was spent working on focusing the ready button in poker when an estimate is full and working on the backend development for the new pending and current member modals. Olive is still working on finishing up the new sandbox so Ive started by creating the web socket end point functions which I know I will need like confirming the text has been copied to the keyboard, retrieving the pending members invite link assigned to them, getting the data a user became a member of the project and an Ajax call to re-send the same invite link back to the pending member. None of these where particularly difficult but I spent a lot of time trying to avoid a web socket call for getting the start date and invite link. This did not work and I instead retrieve the invite from the payload of the web socket call and then install that entity in the project state so it can be easily retrieved on the front end. I did something very similar for the start date. Focusing the ready button has proved to be more difficult than I imagined. At first I tried to use wjs/focus to focus on the ready button once the estimate was full so the user can hit enter on it. This was not working, and it didn’t help that there where already listeners in place for the estimate card hotkeys. The next thing Im gonna try is making another hotkey function that creates and destroys itself right after use so it doesn’t interfere with the other listeners.
