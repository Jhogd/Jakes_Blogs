As of Friday I have now completed two weeks of my apprenticeship and I am happy to say that 

I am enjoying the job and I am learning a lot. I have surprised myself a bit when it comes to 

learning Clojure because the language is making more sense to me everyday. I found myself 

solving Euler problems 5-6 much faster than the other 4 and I think it is a combination of 

utilizing test driven development better, as well as knowing more Clojure which has allowed me 

to put my thoughts to code faster than I could for the other problems. I have definitely become 

a fan of TTD as breaking a large complex problem into small simple components has made me 

more efficient at solving problems. As Friday ended I completed my first week of stories. 

Foremost, it felt nice completing my first set of tasks but it feels even better because I enjoyed 

doing them and I did them the correct way. 



Here is a list of some of things I have learned in my first two weeks:

1) What is clean code and why is it worth it to have clean code from the start of a project

2) Function names and why it is important to display intent with your code

3) Koans to learn Clojure syntax and some common usage of functions

4) How big should a function be? How to make a function only have one purpose and why function size is important 

5) Good function and code habits such as the number of parameters a function should take, what temporal coupling is and other good coding practices related to functions and side effects

6) How code should be formatted, why comments should be extremely rate, a good line length and why code that communicates well is so important

7) Euler problems 1-6 where I really focused on test driven development and started to learn how to actually write Clojure

8) The primary and secondary jobs of software

9) The Single Responsibility Principle

10) Why software architecture should be focused on its Use cases and how important it is that when someone looks at your software they see the use case and not that is a web system or console system etcâ€¦

11) How OOP is really about inverting dependencies meaning high level classes and modules are not dependent on low level classes and modules.

12) Completing fizzbuzz my first Kata practice and demonstration



I am excited to continue my apprenticeship and receive my next set of stories.
