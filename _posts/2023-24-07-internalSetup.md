title: Internal Setup

This week I was tasked with completing stories for our internal development site Epic. It's very cool to see my first real fullstack project in clojure and I am amazed by how intriquite and complex it is. I am still having a bit of a challenge understanding some aspects of the code but it will come to me the more I work with it. One of the many things I have learned already is how to write more comprehensive tests even when the code would appear difficult to test. Spec helpers like bucket-helper allow side effects to be tested in a much simpler way. I have also seen very useful front end spec helpers like wire allow you to simulate click events in javascript and others like wire/select, wire/flush which aid a great deal in making specs easier to write. I have just begun but I feel confident in Alex and I's ability to learn and complete these internal tasks. I feel this is a huge step in my software craftsmen journey and I look forward to more projects and work.
