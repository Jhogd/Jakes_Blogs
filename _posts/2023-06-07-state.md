I am happy with the state of my current HttpServer. On Wednesday when I had IPM my code was functional but it was not the cleanest and parts of the code did not adhere to some of the solid principles. My httpHandler class was not extensible because I dispatched the resource coming in form the socket with a switch statement, meaning I would have to edit that function and class whenever I want to add another site. I fixed this through utilization of the command pattern where each response to the output socket has its own class and each of those classes implement a serve interface which contains a sendResponse function. This way the main can just instantiate the classes and paths and the server will work accordingly. I did not adhere to the SRP in my game class because I was generating html responses and performing game logic in the same class. To fix this I broke the class apart in to two classes, one that handles all the game logic and one that simply spits out html based on results from the game class. My server is in a much more configurable state now which is neccessary for my new iteration where I need to make a web app that uses both my server and my tic tac toe to build a functioning tic tac toe game that is playable on my server.
