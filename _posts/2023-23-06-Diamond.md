title: Diamond Kata

This week I was tasked with completing a kata in java. I have not used the language since one of my beginner classes in college but I was excited to work with it again now that I feel like a much stronger programmer. The kata I decided to do was the diamond kata. This kata requires the programmer to print a diamond starting with A where the widest point in the diamond is the character inputted.

I was able to achieve this through a couple simple functions. I first get the number of spaces needed between the characters so for B we have one C 3, D 5, etc. I then wrote a function that got all the preliminary space we needed to put before the letter depending on what character was the widest. Lastly, I put it all together in a print_diamond function that handles the rest of the logic.
```java
public static int get_spaces(String character){
    int number_spaces = 0;
    String alphabet = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
   for (int i = 0; i < alphabet.length(); i++){
       String current_char = Character.toString(alphabet.charAt(i));
       if (current_char.equals(character)){
           number_spaces = i;
       }
   }
return number_spaces;
}
    public static String format_triangle(String character){
    String new_string = "";
    int number_spaces =  Diamond.get_spaces(character);
    if (character.equals("A")){
        new_string = character;
    }
    else {
    new_string = " ".repeat((2 * number_spaces) -1);
    new_string = character + new_string + character;
    }

    return new_string;
    }



    public static String prelim_space (String character, String character2){
    String new_string = "";
    String one_space = " ";
    int number_spaces_char1 = Diamond.get_spaces(character);
    int number_spaces_char2 = Diamond.get_spaces(character2);
    new_string = one_space.repeat((number_spaces_char2 - number_spaces_char1));
    return new_string;
    }
```
I am happy I got this working and I am excited to keep working with java.
