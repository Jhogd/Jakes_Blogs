Making my AI more unbeatable


While running my game countless times I began to notice that when the AI was player O or player 2 it would sometimes play a move that is not the most optimal. This is because it would generate an evaluation with a move and if another move down the line had the same evaluation it would still choose the first move associated with that eval. The first thing I did to fix this was to return a map of moves and evaluations instead of just one move and then I select randomly from the set of best-moves. This made the AI when playing as X feel more human and made it play optimally still but it did not fix the issue when the AI was player 2. In order to fix this I changed the minimax function a tiny bit so that when it was player 2 it would call the minimax like it was player X and then it would select the maximum move. By doing this it is finding the optimal move for X and then selecting that one therefore, ALWAYS choosing the best move to block the other player. Now the AI is completely impossible to beat regardless of who is going first. The last change I made was simply a best “first” move for when the AI is playing as X. This just ensures the it will select 0 or a corner spot for the first move and then after that it will select randomly from the map of best moves

Here is the code changes:

```clojure
(defn minimax [board player]
  (loop [[move & moves] (list-empties (:state board))
         best-move -1
         best-val -1000
         best-coll {best-move best-val}]
    (if move
      (let [new-board (new-board-minimax board player move)
            eval (min-value new-board (switch-player player) 1)]
        (recur moves move eval (conj best-coll {move eval})))
      best-coll)))

(defn filter-greatest-vals [move-eval-map]
  (into {} (filter #(= (val %) (apply max (vals move-eval-map))) move-eval-map)))


(defn contains-neg? [best-map]
  (boolean (some #(neg? (val %)) best-map)))

(defn get-neg-key [best-map]
  (some (fn [[k v]] (when (neg? v) k)) best-map))

(defmulti best-first :dimension)

(defmethod best-first :two [board]
 0)

(defmethod best-first :three [board]
  13)

(defn best-move [board player]
  (let [best-moves-map (dissoc (minimax board player) -1)]
    (cond
      (and (contains-neg? best-moves-map) (= player O)) (get-neg-key best-moves-map)
      (all-empty-space? (:state board)) (best-first board)
      :else
      (rand-nth (keys (filter-greatest-vals best-moves-map)))
      )))
```
