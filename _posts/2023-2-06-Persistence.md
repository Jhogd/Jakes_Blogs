File Persistence using EDN:

I am still new to file persistence, saving states and maintaining a database like structure but 
having to implement an elementary version of this has helped me a lot. Creating a good database
or file keeping system is extremely important to larger real life systems, where tons of data is 
being stored and manipulated. In this case it is only for a simple tic-tac-toe application but 
it still teaches the basics and acts as a good starting point. For my system I created a 
file-persistence file that housed important functions for saving game-states to the base 
file, and grabbing the last board as well as grabbing the entire files worth of games.

```clojure
(defn grab-last-game [file-name]
  (with-open [reader (io/reader file-name)]
    (->> (line-seq reader)
         (remove str/blank?)
         last
         read-string)))

(defn save-board [board current-player game-number level level-two file-name]
  (spit file-name (utility/->game-state board current-player game-number level level-two)
        :append true)
  (spit file-name "\n" :append true))

(defn grab-games [file-name]
  (slurp file-name))
```
 These three functions are the primary handler of the file persistence system. 

```clojure
(def game-state {:board nil :player nil :game-number 0 :difficulty nil :difficulty2 nil})

(defn ->game-state [board current-player game-number level level-two]
   (assoc game-state :board board :player current-player :game-number game-number :difficulty level
```

The game-state map and game-state function work with the save-board function to save the 
board, current player, game-number and two difficulties for the aiâ€™s. Storing all of this provides 
the necessary information to determine if the last game played was finished or not and return 
the required pieces such as the current-player and game-mode so that the user can decide if 
they want to resume their previous game or start a new one. Next I will add a sql database to 
the application and the data will be saved in both the database and the text-file.
