title: The great Merge

Merging multiple projects together was an inevitable step in completing the tic tac toe web app, so I figured I can go over how I was able to do those things in a very simple and effective way. To begin I decided to make the new web app in Clojure meaning I needed to bring over my java htttpServer to this new project. IntelliJ has a very simple way of packaging java projects, all I had to do was select file then project structure,  Artifacts and then there is a plus sign where you can add a new Jar file which will build a jar file and place it in a named package. Now we can simply add a new folder called Resource in our new project where we can move this server jar file. To finish implementing the java package we must go in to our deps.edn file and do something similar to this
```clojure
{
 :paths ["src" "resources"]
 :deps {
        ogden.jake/httpserver {:local/root “./resources/HttpServer.jar”}
```
We need to specify that the package is coming from a local source and then specify that source which in this case is ./resources. 

Now all of the java classes are available to call. Next we need to add the original tic tac toe and this can be done in a really cool way. 
```clojure
io.github.Jhogd/TIc-Tac-Toe-app {:git/url "https://github.com/Jhogd/TIc-Tac-Toe-app.git" :sha “07984be0d12e874068f3c697a62595d6527ea466"}
```
All we have to do is call our code form GitHub in the deps.edn file like it shows above. Now we have both projects within our new one and can begin making new code.
