title: Why so slow??

While building my first gui in quil for the Langtonâ€™s ant kata I ran into an interesting situation. I had gotten my gui to work and display the correct colored squares but it became increasingly and frustratingly slow as I increased the grid size to accurately display the final pattern. This was clearly not okay as I needed about 11000 iterations and the grid needed to be at least 81 by 81 in size. Originally I was sending a multidimensional vector to a draw function that assigned a color to each square based on the value at that index. This is clearly the issue as it has to iterate through the entire vector and then draw each square sequentially for every single iteration. To solve this I changed the update-grid function to simulate a given set of moves at a time to exponentially speed up the process of drawing to the gui. 

```clojure
(defn update-grid-nth-times [{:keys [board simulation-count position direction]}]
  (prn "count" simulation-count)
  (if (< simulation-count 0)
    {:board board :position position :simulation-count simulation-count :direction direction}
    (loop [current-board board pos position dir direction count 0]
      (if (> count 220)
        {:board            current-board
         :position         pos
         :simulation-count (dec simulation-count)
         :direction        dir}
        (recur (change-color current-board pos)
               (move dir current-board pos)
               (rotate-ant dir current-board pos)
               (inc count))))))
```
Here the function is simulating 220 moves at a time before it sends the board back to the draw function. This means I only actually have to call the draw function 50 times instead of 11000 times which is obviously much faster but I can update this function to simulate even more moves at a time if needed.
