title: Refactor till you drop

This week I have been tasked with adding more features to my tic-tac-toe game like the ability 

to play 3D tic-tac-toe and to have file persistence so that the user can see all of the previous 

games when launching the game and can even resume an unfinished one if it did not complete. 

Making more changes first required some refactoring of my code to decouple and clean up my 

existing code to allow these changes and future changes to be more smooth.

One thing I did was turn my difficulty settings into a multi method and I got rid of excess code \

by making the bulk of what they shared in common separate functions.

```clojure
(defn level-decision? [standard]
  (let [random (rand)]
    (< random standard)))

(defmulti Ai-level? :level)

(defmethod Ai-level? :easy [_]
  (level-decision? 0.8))

(defmethod Ai-level? :medium [_]
  (level-decision? 0.3))

(defmethod Ai-level? :unbeatable [_]
  (level-decision? -1.0))

(defn ai-standard [level board player]
  (if (Ai-level? level)
    (rand-nth (list-empties (:state board)))
    (best-move board player)))
```

Another thing I did was create a board protocol which currently houses the initialize board but if 

new requirements come up and there are more board specific functionalities that need to be 

added I can now simply add to the protocol and records. Additionally, I changed the board f

from a simple vector to a map that has a :state and a :size. This way I do not have to pass a 

size variable around the program and the size is instead associated with the board that is being 

used. 
```clojure
(defprotocol Board
  (init-board [this])

 )

(defrecord Four-by-four []
  Board
  (init-board [this] {:state (vec (repeat (* 4 4) EMPTY)) :size 4})

  )

(defrecord Three-by-three []
  Board
  (init-board [this] {:state (vec (repeat (* 3 3) EMPTY)) :size 3})
  )

(defrecord Three-dimension []
  Board
  (init-board [this] {:state (vec (repeat (* 9 3) EMPTY)) :size 3})
  
  )

```
Today I am going to take out the bulk of my play loop that is currently in each of the different 

play styles and create a play-game function to help reduce more excess code.I still have more r

efactoring to do and I need to continue adding file persistence but these 

changes have already helped make my code cleaner and as Uncle Bob said, I just need to 

refactor until I drop.
