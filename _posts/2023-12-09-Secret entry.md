Today I made a lot of progress on this weeks iteration and I feel I am in a good spot to finish everything and have a good demo on Friday. For the most part I worked on implementing the invite link so that someone can join a project. We recently made some changes where you have to be an established member of the project in order to gain access. Because of this we needed a separate link that is not the project url that can grant a user access and place them in a project. Originally, I was thinking of doing something similar as a lot of client to backend processes are handled and that was by installing the invite link on the project state namespace and then getting the invite entity and project from there. Brandon pointed out that this should really only be handled on the server side as we want the link to directly take the user to the project after signing in. I would say I am about 95% done with this story, I can generate a 20 character long unique link that a non member can click on and they will become a member and placed in the project, the unique link is only usable a single time and this all done on the server side. The only thing left for me to do is handle the case where the user is not signed in and they click on the link, and then I need to set something up so that users who have not clicked the email can see pending projects in their home screen.
