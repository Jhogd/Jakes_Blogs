This week I have been tasked with creating a HTTP server in java using RFC 1.1. This is all very new to me but I am glad that I am getting the chance to challenge myself and learn more about HTTP and servers. So far the most challenging part is creating tests that I can use to develop my production code. The challenge lies with the fact that sockets try to establish a connection with the computers hardware, and most of the testable functions are void meaning there is no return variable that I can test against. The other part that makes this challenging is that this is all in java. I am having to learn how to write clean java code as well as how to mock classes and functions so that I can adequately and properly test my code. I now have less than a week to finish this server but I am confident that I can get it done, and I think it will get easier as I learn more.
