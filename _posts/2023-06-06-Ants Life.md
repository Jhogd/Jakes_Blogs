Langstons Ant


I have completed my first iteration of the Langstons Ant kata using TDD. Doing this kata helped strengthen my test driven development skills as it was quite a bit more complicated than the previous two katas I had done. The rules for this kata is pretty simple, an ant starts out on a white tile and if it is on a white tile it turns 90 degrees to the right and turns the square black and then moves forward one unit. If the ant lands on a black square it turns 90 degrees to the left and turns the square red. Lastly, if the ant lands on a red square it does not turn but it changes the square to white and moves forward one unit. The typical KATA only has the first two rules with white and black squares but I wanted to try the new rules and see if I could complete it.


I am happy to say I did get it to work and I am currently optimizing my gui to display the kata correctly.
```clojure
(defn move-right [board starting-pos]
  (let [col-count (dec (count (first board)))
        row-count (dec (count board))
        [row col] starting-pos
        next-row (if (= starting-pos [row-count col-count]) row (if (> (inc col) col-count) (inc row) row))
        next-col (if (= starting-pos [row-count col-count]) 0 (if (> (inc col) col-count) 0 (inc col)))]
    [next-row next-col]))

(defn move-left [board starting-pos]
  (let [col-count (dec (count (first board)))
        [row col] starting-pos
        next-row (if (= starting-pos [0 0]) row (if (= col 0)  (dec row) row))
        next-col (if (= starting-pos [0 0]) col-count (if (= col 0) col-count (dec col)))]
    [next-row next-col]))

(defn move-down [board starting-pos]
  (let [[row col] starting-pos
        row-count (dec (count board))
    next-row (if (= row 0) row-count (dec row))]
    [next-row col]))

(defn move-up [board starting-pos]
  (let [[row col] starting-pos
        row-count (dec (count board))
        next-row (if (= row row-count) 0 (inc row))]
    [next-row col]))


(defn change-color [board index]
  (cond
    (= (get-in board index) 0) (assoc-in board index 1)
    (= (get-in board index) 1) (assoc-in board index 2)
    (= (get-in board index) 2) (assoc-in board index 0)
    ))

```

The basic mechanics of program are move functions which move left right up or down and then functions are called based on the given direction which is a keyword and whether the ant is on a white, black or red square. Here I have represented white black and red with 0 1 and 2 for my multidimensional vector. The actual play loop is located in my gui file because it needs to update the graphics on the gui every iteration.
```clojure
(defn simulate-ant [board simulation-count]
  (loop [position (middle-index board)
         direction :right
         counter 0
         game-board board]
    (draw position (number-to-color (get-in game-board position)))
    (if (> counter simulation-count)
      nil
      (recur (move direction game-board position)
             (rotate-ant direction game-board position)
             (inc counter) (change-color game-board position)))))
```
The move function gets the new location of the ant, rotate-ant, changed the direction and change color swaps the numbers based on the rules. Overall, I am happy with it but on my next run through I will try and make it more open for change by removing conditionals if possible.
