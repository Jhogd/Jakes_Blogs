title: Hiccup in clojure

While working on building my tic tac toe web app I stumbled upon a really cool Clojure feature that aids in generating html. This feature is called hiccup. Hiccup is a simple way to represent and generate HTML in Clojure. In fact Reagent which I will be using later is returns hiccup. 

```clojure
[:html
 [:head
  [:title "Tic Tac Toe"]
  [:style ".board {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 100px);
        gap: 10px;
    }

    .square {
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
        font-size: 24px;
        font-weight: bold;
        background-color:pink;
    }‚Äù]]
```
Hiccup makes it very easy to do CSS styling as well. 
```clojure
[:body
 [:div.board
  [:a {:href "/tttGame/pos=0"} [:button.square (key-to-string (nth state 0))]]
  [:a {:href "/tttGame/pos=1"} [:button.square (key-to-string (nth state 1))]]
  [:a {:href "/tttGame/pos=2"} [:button.square (key-to-string (nth state 2))]]
  [:a {:href "/tttGame/pos=3"} [:button.square (key-to-string (nth state 3))]]
  [:a {:href "/tttGame/pos=4"} [:button.square (key-to-string (nth state 4))]]
  [:a {:href "/tttGame/pos=5"} [:button.square (key-to-string (nth state 5))]]
  [:a {:href "/tttGame/pos=6"} [:button.square (key-to-string (nth state 6))]]
  [:a {:href "/tttGame/pos=7"} [:button.square (key-to-string (nth state 7))]]
  [:a {:href "/tttGame/pos=8"} [:button.square (key-to-string (nth state 8))]]
  [:a {:href "/ttt"} [:button.square "New Game"]]]]]))
```
This is an example of defining multiple hyperlinks and shaping them to be the buttons I described above. I think it is insanely cool that Clojure has libraries like this to help with web development and I am excited to keep learning more.
