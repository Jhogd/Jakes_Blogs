   I just wanted to take the time today to quickly talk about my apprenticeship and the progress I 

have made as an employee at Clean Coders Studio. It is crazy to think I am almost done with 

phase two of this apprenticeship and that it has almost been two months that I have been 

working here for. I have learned more in this short period of time than I had thought possible 

and I am enjoying software more than I had previously thought I would. That’s not to say I 

didn’t think I would enjoy it because I did, but I did not believe I was going to feel this satisfied 

waking up every day to complete my tasks. Despite the enjoyment I am having it has still been 

challenging coming from an electrical engineering background and so it felt I had a little more 

catching up to do than some people would have entering an apprenticeship like this. I have 

worked hard every week to complete all of my stories and I  have been pleased by my work for 

the most part but there have been two instances where I did not have a story completely 

finished and it made me feel embarrassed because I never want to miss any stories and I have 

learned valuable lessons from those two events. The first one was a side effect of not asking 

for help earlier in the week when it came to my linked-node and array-list demo and I decided 

to demo it on a lunch n learn where I learned that I had some improper implementations and 

was forced to change it before Monday. Due to the late hiccup I did not have time to complete 

the fixes and I would have avoided this if I talked through my code and asked for help earlier in 

the week. The second event was that I did not have my kata completion under 15 minutes long 

and this one was a case of spending too much time on my gui for the kata and just 

underestimating a bit of how many times I needed to do the kata from scratch before I could 

be efficient enough to be always under 15 minutes. I am happy that my last iteration went well 

and my tic-tac-toe is starting to feel like an actual application. I look forward to entering 

another phase of the apprenticeship and completing more stories.
