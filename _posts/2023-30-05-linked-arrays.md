title: Linked-lists and Array-lists

Why do we need array-lists and linked-lists, why canâ€™t we just use arrays?

An array has a predefined size and that size is fixed once the array is created so the two ways \

to solve this problem are to use array-lists and linked-lists.

Differences between Java array-lists and  linked-lists:

These are just the most common differences between array-lists and linked-lists and they both 

have their upside and downside. Linked-lists are much better if you need to manipulate your 

data a lot as they are much faster and more efficient than array-lists, especially when trying to 

replace a value in in the middle of an array-list as the entire array will need to be shifted in 

memory. On the other hand array-lists should be used when you need to access data a lot as 

they are faster than linked-lists. I will be demonstrasting how to create and utilize both 

linked-lists and array-lists later this week in clojure and I am excited to share my code.
