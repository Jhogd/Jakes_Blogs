title: Handling Post Requests

Until my last IPM meeting I had been using GET requests for all functionalities in my htttp server. I had everything working but this is not how http servers usually work and it is more realistic to use a post request when a user input is needed. I thought handling a post request would be simple and I would simply need to read every line that came in through the socket with a buffered reader. This unfortunately was not the case. Originally, I tried to read the next line until the input was null. I would get the data I wanted from the user but the problem is it is never actually null until EOF or the client disconnects, so the server would not be able to send a response back to the browser and the browser would be stuck loading. Due to this I had to look more into Post requests and how to read both the header and body. I realized I was able to read until the next line was empty meaning all white space instead of null and this got the entire body. I then found the content length which was the number of bytes that the body contained. Once this was attained I simply created a for loop and read however many bytes that the content length was. This worked perfectly and I donâ€™t know if a better solution exists than this.
```clojure
public void getPieces() throws IOException {
    String line;
    StringBuilder contentBuilder = new StringBuilder();
    StringBuilder postHeader = new StringBuilder();
    while (!((line = input.readLine()).isEmpty())) {
        postHeader.append(line);
        if (line.contains("Content-Length:")) {
            String[] contentLengthArray = line.split(" ");
            this.contentLength = Integer.parseInt(contentLengthArray[1]);
        }

    }
    for (int i = 0; i < contentLength; i++){
        int contentByte = input.read();
        contentBuilder.append((char)contentByte);
    }
    this.queryResult = contentBuilder.toString();
```
